# CHICODE
ChiCode aims to motivate young children to explore the different aspects of technology. By setting up customized tutorials according to experience level, we hope to allow every student to learn at their own pace. 

ChiCode offers free online lessons on the most popular programming languages, Python and Java along with customized tutoring sessions by appointment.
